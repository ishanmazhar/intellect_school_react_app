            With a single-minded pursuit to spread the light of quality education among the middle class, the idea of establishing Intellect
            IntellectSchool Dhaka was mooted by the visionaries of Intellect Group and as a consequence, the school was established in 2009.
            It is a collaborative venture between Intellect Group, one of the most prestigious corporate houses in Bangladesh, and the
            Delhi Public School Society (Intellect), a pioneer in education since 1949, with more than 200 schools in 13 countries worldwide.
            This Global Network, with its transcontinental identity, is not merely a list of institutions, persons or facts, but is rather
            a network of values, systems and relationships.
